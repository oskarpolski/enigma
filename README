Hello in order to run our code Enigma! You have to use EMACS! 
	1. open up Enigma4.ml  and compile the code using Ctrl C Ctrl B!
	2. In order to run Enigma, after the code has finished compiling type in the following lines
			Enigma "Your Message" list "3 Letters" "3 Letters" 
				list is just a prebuilt rotor order, we built this in for ease, but you are free to use one of our 5 rotors.
				the settings can be typed like this let list = [r33a; r22a; r11a; refl];;
			A typical Command Line can Look like 
				Enigma "My name is Bob" list "AFK" "YHZ";;
				and you should get Bytes = "Decrypted message"
			To check that it has been encryted properly, type in the same command line, but for the message change it into 
			the Decrypted message and you should end up with "MYNAMEISBOB"
	3. In order to Decrypt a mesage you have to open Decrypt.ml and once again compile the code using Ctrl C Ctrl B
	Decrypt.ml TAKES A LONG TIME TO RUN, it goes through over 18 billion of different options and may take 10 to 30 minutes in order
	to decrypt the message. 
	4. In terminal you make the whole file and then type break_enigma "message" and it will break the message
